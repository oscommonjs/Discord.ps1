# Discord.ps1

## About
### Discord.ps1 is really pointless way for you to waste 8GB RAM hosting and to connect and interact with the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) through Powershell.

`Invoke-Discord.ps1` and `Sockets-Discord.ps1` are needed for this to function correctly, 
## PROJECT WAS ABANDONED DUE TO API GATEWAY UPDATES AND WILL NOT BE UPDATED

## Needed Modules
[ConvertTo-Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/ConvertTo-Json) - Powershell 5.1 and above
Send-DiscordMsg - comes with repo clone
Invoke-DiscordBot - comes with repo clone (Install module Invoke-DiscordBot-Dev and allias)

## Why?
This was originally made as a joke but i decided to attept to make it real, 

![This started it all](how_discord.ps1_became_a_thing.png)

## Todo
- [ ] Write docs and make examples on how to connect your bot.
- [ ] Write docs on how to make commands.
## Contributing

### Backstory
So me and a few people were talking about making a discord lib with a dumb language so i ended up making a suggestion for Powershell and they had doubt in me,
