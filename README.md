# Discord.ps1



# THIS PROJECT WAS ABANDONED
## This repo will still be here as a legacy asset

## About
### Discord.ps1 is really pointless way for you to waste 8GB RAM hosting and to connect and interact with the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) through Powershell.

## Why?
This was originally made as a joke but i decided to attept to make it real, 
Currently it is in a really **WIP** state, Crashes, Memory leaks and accidental bugs are very common currently

## Todo

- [ ] Make the lib actually worth using and stable before sharing.
- [ ] Write docs and make examples on how to connect your bot.
- [ ] Write docs on how to make commands.
## Contributing
Helping build up this will be amazing, In its current state i'd rather keep it private tho, I've made this github so when it is ready to be shared we can all admire how shit my coding is, Then you can improve it. 
## Help
If you need help with this, I really can't help you, This isn't supposed to be used as a main lib, If you want an actual working lib for a bot use Discord.js or Eris, Maybe you will find others who know them langs,
